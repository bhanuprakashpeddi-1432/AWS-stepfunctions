# Enhanced Local IDE Workflow for AWS Step Functions

This project demonstrates how to build, test, and deploy AWS Step Functions state machines using the enhanced local IDE experience provided by Workflow Studio in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) via the AWS Toolkit extension.

---

## Features

- Visual and code-based authoring of Step Functions state machines in VS Code
- Seamless switching between graphical (Design) and code (ASL) modes
- Support for Amazon States Language (ASL) in JSON and YAML formats
- Integrated with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools via Definition Substitutions
- Granular state testing using the Step Functions TestState API from your IDE
- Streamlined code-test-deploy-debug workflow

---

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio Code
- AWS Toolkit extension for VS Code (version 3.49.0 or later)
- AWS account and credentials configured
- State machine definition files with `.asl.json`, `.asl.yml`, or `.asl.yaml` extension

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install and Configure

- Install the [AWS Toolkit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AmazonWebServices.aws-toolkit-vscode) in VS Code.
- Configure your AWS credentials in the Toolkit.

### 2. Create or Import a State Machine

- Open or create a state machine definition file (`*.asl.json`, `*.asl.yml`, or `*.asl.yaml`).
- Open Workflow Studio using:
  - The “Open with Workflow Studio” action at the top of the file
  - The Workflow Studio icon in the editor pane
  - The file context-menu in the file explorer

### 3. Authoring Workflows

- **Design Mode:** Drag and drop states to visually build your workflow. The ASL definition updates automatically.
- **Code Mode:** Edit the ASL definition directly in JSON or YAML. Changes are synced with the visual editor.
- Save your changes to persist them.

### 4. Integrate with Infrastructure as Code

You can use Definition Substitutions for dynamic references in your workflow definition.  
**Example (CloudFormation):**

## Testing

- Select a state in Workflow Studio and open the Inspector panel.
- Click the **Test state** button.
- Select your IAM role and provide input data. If using Definition Substitutions, specify their values.
- Click **Start Test**. Review results before deploying.

---

## Deployment

- Publish your workflow from VS Code using the AWS Toolkit.
- Alternatively, deploy using AWS SAM, AWS CDK, or CloudFormation as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep state machine definitions in version control with your application and IaC code.
- Use Definition Substitutions for flexibility and reusability.
- Test individual states before deploying the entire workflow.
- Use the visual editor for rapid prototyping and the code editor for fine-grained control.
